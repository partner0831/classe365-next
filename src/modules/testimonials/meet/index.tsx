              Classe365 is all about flexibility, affordability and
              technological sophistication. Prior to Classe365, we had no CRM.
              We expanded 60% of our human capital manually managing data. This
              antiquated process was unproductive, it exhausted our human
              capital and it made us more susceptible to errors
